# Farming Simulator


## Description

Farming simulation game created in Unity 2020.3.6.

2D grid-based world which features a "farmer" who occupies 1 tile, and can move around the world using "W-A-S-D" keys.

The player can interact with objects using the "E" key.

The farmer can carry 1 item at a time. Items can be picked up and put down on any unoccupied tile.

There is a seed shop. You can buy seed from the seed shop for 1 coin. You start with 3 coins.

Seeds can be planted on empty tiles and will grow into wheat in 20 seconds.

Grown wheat can be collected by the farmer 5 times before the tile is exhausted, whereupon it can be replanted.

Wheat sacks can be ground by the windmill into flour. The windmill can grind 1 sack at a time, and takes 10 seconds per sack.

Flour can be sold to the grocer. Sold flour will give the player 2 coins.

Feel free to alter, improve or extend the mechanics if you want.
